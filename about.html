			<h1>What We Believe</h1>
				<div>
				We believe there is one eternally existing GOD
				who has three distinct persons: GOD the Father,
				GOD the Son, and GOD the Holy Spirit. He is the
				creator of all that exists, both visible and invisible,
				and is therefore worthy of all glory and
				praise. GOD is perfect in love, power, holiness,
				goodness, knowledge, wisdom, justice, and
				mercy. He is unchangeable and therefore is the
				same yesterday, today, and forever. 
				 </div>
				<h1>Our Mission</h1>
				<div>To advance the Kingdom, multiply the body of Christ, and make disciples for Christ.</div>
				<h1>Our Vision</h1>
				<div>To be a body of believers that become the church, that know their identity, walk in their purpose, possess a passion to be disciples, make  disciples and Transform generations one life at a time.</div>
				<h1>John 1:12</h1>
				<div>“But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name:”</div>
